# ACG_project2

This step of the series of three projects for advanced computer graphics

This project builds off the first step, where the shading functions for both spheres and walls were added to apply local shading (ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting).
The second step to this project is to add a obj file polygon mesh to the scene, add a triangle shading function, and correctly shade the polygon mesh.
